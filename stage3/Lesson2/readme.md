Classes and objects have a lot to do with it. 

Our goal in lesson two is to send a text message with a python package called Twilio. Twilio is an external python package. 

What is a class? Classes give us the ability to create more complicated data structures that contain arbitrary content. We can create a Pet class that keeps track of the name and species of the pet. A class defines how something should be laid out or structured but doesn't actually fill in the content.

What is an instance of a class?  An instance is a specific copy of the class that does contain all of the content. For example, if I create a pet polly, with name "Polly" and species "Parrot", then polly is an instance of the class Pet. 

What's another anology to explain classes? Letâ€™s say that the government has a particular tax form that it requires everybody to fill out. Everybody has to fill out the same type of form, but the content that people put into the form differs from person to person. A class is like the form: it specifies what content should exist. Your copy of the form with your specific information if like an instance of the class: it specifies what the content actually is.
