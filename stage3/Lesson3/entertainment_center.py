# Lesson 3.4: Make Classes
# Mini-Project: Movies Website

# In this file, you will define instances of the class Movie defined
# in media.py. After you follow along with Kunal, make some instances
# of your own!

# After you run this code, open the file fresh_tomatoes.html to
# see your webpage!

#use the contents of my other python file
import media
#import fresh_tomatoes

#media is the name of my other python file and movie is the name of the class inside that file.
toy_story = media.Movie("Toy Story", "A story about toys", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Toy_Story.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZv1vki4ou4")

print (toy_story.storyline)

#avatar = media.Movie()

#movies = [toy_story, avatar]
