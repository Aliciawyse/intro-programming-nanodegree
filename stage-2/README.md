#Stage 2: Mad-Libs (fill-in-the-blanks) Game

This game has three levels and each level has four or more blanks. When the program runs, the user is prompted to select a difficulty level such as easy, medium or hard. Once a level is selected, the program displays a fill-in-the-blank paragraph, and the user is prompted to take a guess at the first blank.

When the player guesses corrrectly, a new prompt shows with the correct answer in the previous blank and asks the user for input for the next blank space. When the user guesses incorrectly, he or she is prompted to try again. 

Takeaway: This program can be used as a study tool to help you remember important vocabulary.
